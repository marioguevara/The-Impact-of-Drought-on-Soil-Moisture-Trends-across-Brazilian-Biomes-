BRArandomPoints.rds

10000 Random points selected across Brazil in a native format of R. 
These points contain coordinates (x,y) in geografical CRS. We augment 
these points with satellite soil moisture information 2009 and 2015 in 
a montly basis. 

The source of soil moisture data is the version 4.5 of the ESA-CCI soil moisture dataset:
https://esa-soilmoisture-cci.org/ 

We also augment these points with gridded environmental data described 
previously here https://soil.copernicus.org/articles/4/173/2018/ 
and here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yr09cPDoSVdoahN_fXcNLfgipQcCodRl66WCcj6hJ9A/edit?usp=sharing
